# Grocery Shopping

## ***Introduction***
This app is used to help better visualize your grocery list.  Usually one would use your notes app and it would just be a plain list. Here you can easily add and delete items to your list. You can delete with a click of a button instead of erasing manually. This app will help color code and organize your list by section. Items will be arranged by section and color coded. As a result you won't have to go back and forth between grocery aisles. You will be able to more efficiently scan your long list and look for items.

## ***Motivation***
Motivation for this project was to help practice my MERN and CRUD knowledge. 
Motivation was to create an app that'll organizeg your grocery list and color code it.

## Code Thoughts and Approach
**Drew out frame work on lucid




**Create a Nav Bar **

**- Nav Bar Features**
 
 Home page section or welcome screen
 Index Page for grocery list
 Add Item page to add new item to list
 
 
 
 




**Grocery List**
Displays logged in users grocery list.
Only logged in users can view their grocery list.


**Show View**
Displays logged in users grocery item.
Only logged in users can view their grocery item.

**Edit View** 
Displays logged in users grocery item edit form.

# Installation Instructions

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
